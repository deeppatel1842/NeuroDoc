Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad hoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases such issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number of retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are relevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation.",

We introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Gen- eration ( SELF-RAG)that enhances an LM's quality and factuality through retrieval and self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively retrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages and its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens. Generating reflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements.

However, these methods may hinder the versatility of LLMs or introduce unnecessary or off-topic passages that lead to low-quality generations (Shi et al. , 2023) since they retrieve passages indiscriminately regardless of whether the factual grounding is helpful. Moreover, the output is not guaranteed to be consistent with retrieved relevant passages (Gao et al. , 2023) since the models are not explicitly trained to leverage and follow facts from provided passages.

Then, we compare the model performance on PopQA, PubHealth, and ASQA (citation precision) with our final SELF- RAGtrained on the full 150k instances. We also evaluate Figures 4a, 4b and 4c shows the models' performance trained on different amount of data. Across all datasets, increasing data size often shows upward trajectories and the improvements are significantly larger in PopQA and ASQA, while we do not observed such significant improvements on Llama2-FT 7Bwhen increasing the training data from 50k to 150k.

Human evaluations. We conduct small human evaluations on SELF-RAGoutputs, as well as the reliability of predicted reflection tokens. In particular, we sampled 50 samples from PopQA and Bio results. Following Menick et al. (2022), human annotators evaluate S P , which indicates whether the model output is plausible (i. e. , the output is a reasonable and on-topic response to the question as if it were occurring in a conversation) and supported (i. e. , the provided evidence is sufficient to verify the validity of the answer). For S P, we do not consider the instances where SELF-RAG predicts irrelevant orno support. We then ask our annotators whether the model-predicted reflection tokens about ISRELand ISSUPmatch their inspections (e. g. , whether the fully supported output is supported by the cited evidence).",

Human annotators also find ISRELand ISSUPreflection token predictions are mostly aligned with their assessments. Appendix Table 6 shows several annotated examples and explanations on assessments. 6 C ONCLUSION This work introduces SELF-RAG, a new framework to enhance the quality and factuality of LLMs through retrieval on demand and self-reflection. SELF-RAGtrains an LM to learn to retrieve, generate, and critique text passages and its own generation by predicting the next tokens from its original vocabulary as well as newly added special tokens, called reflection tokens.",

Our holistic evaluations on six tasks using multiple metrics demonstrate that SELF-RAGsignificantly outperforms LLMs with more parameters or with conventional retrieval-augmented generation approaches. 10 Preprint. ETHICAL CONCERNS This work aims to improve the factuality of LLM outputs, the lack of which continues to cause nu- merous real-world problems (e. g. , spread of misinformation and provision of incorrect and dangerous advice).

We found our assessments show high agreement with GPT-4 predictions, especially for relevance (95 ), retrieval necessity (95 ), and the degree of support (90 ).
