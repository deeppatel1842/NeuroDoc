I recently completed my Master's in Computer Science from the University of Oklahoma (May 2025), with a focus on natural language processing, large language models (LLMs), and scalable Generative AI systems. Over the past year, I have led multiple hands-on projects across the GenAI stack from training and fine-tuning models to building end-to-end applications with vector retrieval, reranking, multimodal reasoning, and local deployment. Highlights include: •NeuroDoc : A multi-document RAG assistant supporting PDF upload, hybrid (FAISS   BM25) retrieval, reranking, and citation-grounded answers, with session memory and query history for contextual follow-up.",

These projects reflect my ability to combine deep learning research with practical deployment, using tools such as Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, PyTorch, FastAPI, Docker, AWS Lambda, and PEFT. I also bring industry experience from Firenix Technologies, where I developed ML pipelines for surveillance and optimized CV models for edge deployment. I am excited about contributing to teams that value innovation, efficiency, and real-world AI impact. Thank you for considering my application. Sincerely, Deep Patel 1.",
