      "question": "what is LLM?",
      "answer": "Based on the provided research documents, a Large Language Model (LLM) is a model trained on massive corpora of text, demonstrating the ability to perform new tasks from textual instructions or from a few examples (Brown et al., 2020). According to the research, scaling models to a sufficient size has initially led to these few-shot properties (Kaplan et al., 2020). Document 1 explains that these efforts are based on the assumption that more parameters will lead to better performance, aligning with the broader scaling laws observed in the field. \n\nHowever, recent work, as highlighted by Hoffmann et al. (2022), demonstrates that the best performances aren’t always achieved by the largest models. Instead, smaller models trained on more data can outperform larger ones, particularly within a given compute budget. Document 5 provides a concrete example, noting that adding retrieved documents significantly boosted the performance of LLaMA-13B in the zero-shot setting. The research focuses on models like LLaMA, which ranges from 7B to 65B parameters, and are competitive with models like Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B, as detailed in Document 3.",
